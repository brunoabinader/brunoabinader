## Olá! :wave:

🌍 My name is Bruno Abinader, I am a Brazilian Software Engineer living in [Espoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland).

🌎 My hometown in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) is [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus), in the middle of the [Amazon rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest).

🖥️ I started contributing to open-source projects since the early 2000s, and have since contributed to projects like KDE Plasma, DigiKam, Qt, WebKit, Chromium Blink, Mozilla Servo, ASIO C++ Library, and Mapbox GL Native, among others.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work as an Engineering Manager at Mapbox for the Core SDK team, an internal platform team providing shared foundational components to all Mapbox SDKs.

📝 I have a [blog](https://brunoabinader.github.io/) where I write about open-source development, programming languages, build systems, and shell scripts.
