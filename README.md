## Olá! :wave:

🌍 My name is Bruno Abinader, I am a Brazilian Software Engineer living in [Espoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo), 🇫🇮 [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland).

🌎 My hometown in 🇧🇷 [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) is [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus), at the center of the 🌳 [Amazon rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest).

🖥️ I started contributing to open-source projects since the early 2000s, and have since contributed to projects like [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/), [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [WebKit](https://webkit.org/), [Chromium Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink/), [Mozilla Servo](https://servo.org/), [ASIO C++ Library](https://think-async.com/Asio/), and [Mapbox GL Native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native), among others.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work as an Engineering Manager for the Automotive Integration team at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), integrating Mapbox's Maps, Navigation, and Search SDK stack to key global automakers like Toyota, BMW, Zeekr, among others.

📝 I have a [blog](https://brunoabinader.github.io/) where I write about open-source development, programming languages, build systems, and shell scripts.
