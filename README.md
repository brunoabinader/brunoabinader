## Olá! :wave:

🌍 My name is Bruno Abinader, I am a Brazilian Software Engineer living in [Espoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espoo), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland).

🌎 My hometown in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) is [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus), in the middle of the [Amazon rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest).

🖥️ I started contributing to open-source projects since the early 2000s, and have since contributed to projects like [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/), [DigiKam](https://www.digikam.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [WebKit](https://webkit.org/), [Chromium Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink/), [Mozilla Servo](https://servo.org/), [ASIO C++ Library](https://think-async.com/Asio/), and [Mapbox GL Native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native), among others.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work as Lead Software Engineer at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for the Core SDK team, an internal platform team providing foundational components shared across all Mapbox SDKs.

📝 I have a [blog](https://brunoabinader.github.io/) where I write about open-source development, programming languages, build systems and shell scripts.
